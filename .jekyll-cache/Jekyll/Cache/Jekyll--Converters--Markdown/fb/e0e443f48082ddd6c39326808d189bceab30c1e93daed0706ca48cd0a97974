<p>After talking to my co-hort and good frient Cristobal Gracia about proposal to fellowship program to udk Berlin. He have mentioned about Alexander von Humboldt - naturalist and world famous scientist/artist/geologist/etc from Berlin as a potential cinceptural and historical tie to my project developing in Berlin. He has sugested to think about what does being there means in terms of my project and historical context of the subject that I am touching on. Up on initinal bried reserch here are some ways Humbolt is related to my practice.</p>

<p>Humbot arrived in the time of are of second conquest, where smaniers were try to get as much knowledge and cultural value out of the americas</p>

<p>Using his body as scientific instrunemnt - sencory and aesthetic experience - understand through our own sensations</p>

<p>In a way he is still recognised and grandised as a root and the foundation to contemorary disciplins, geology, zoology etc
