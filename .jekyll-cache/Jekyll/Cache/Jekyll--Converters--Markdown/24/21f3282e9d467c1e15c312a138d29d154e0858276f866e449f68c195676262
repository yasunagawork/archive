<p>Struggle as an vantage point</p>

<p>He starts with describing term like artist, integrity, democracy, peace as inprecise words. And they are our attemt to get to something real behind these words. What these word references are what we believe its real. Strugle for integrity here seems to me here is that the bleiving and standing by these idea and nodes, words that they are real and they do have meaning. And your work, artists work is for the reality we believe and seek. At last I am the one who must stand by my particular kinds of assignment, struggle.</p>

<p>There are an undertone to an idea of martyr. The struggle being an essential part of the idea of artist. Struggle is stated to be universal and struggle for integrity as metaphor for struggle to become human. He references “bringing light” to someone who might hurt you because they live in the dark. And it does not matter what happens to you(artist) but there is a responisibility for such work. The narrative created resembles christian story and ideology, particulary idea of sin, liberation, martyr.</p>

<p>Struggle is not a word I think of everyday. My particular strugle as whatever maybe feel so far from a magnitudes of what is talked here. If struggle is universal, as I interpreted form this recording that finding and confronting the particularity of single experience and working with them might give an individual empathy for others’ struggles. In lookng this through America as a problem, suffering, struggle, injustice are essensial to American experience. And as an anbiguouse looking ailian landing on a land of struggle, what is my roll here? What is my struggle? And is that even the operating system that I need to reside to participate in this conversation?</p>

<p>Is struggle an game engine? Is it an ossilating american engine that is made so well that will not stop? As he mentioned 1963 where we mark 57 years from this lecture. Creating profitable nodes on the landscape of social media with cultural value and magnitude. Alongside of other entertaning social change contents on a suggested bar. Struggle as an entertament. Struggle is profitable in an eyes of 21 centry informational market.</p>

<p>Why does it seems that more time the word is said more diluded something seem to mean?</p>
