<p>He starts with describing term like artist, integrity, democracy, peace as inprecise words. And they are our attemt to get to something real behind these words. What these word references are what we believe its real. Strugle for integrity here seems to me here is that the bleiving and standing by these idea and nodes, words that they are real and they do have meaning. And your work, artists work is for the reality we believe and seek. At last I am the one who must stand by my particular kinds of assignment, struggle.</p>

<p>There are an undertone to an idea of martyr. The struggle being an essential part of the idea of artist. Struggle is stated to be universal and struggle for integrity as metaphor for struggle to become human.</p>

<p>Struggle</p>

<p>He describes hypothetical artists life as a child when the one grow up witnessing the how you see things and how you can’t accept way things are</p>
