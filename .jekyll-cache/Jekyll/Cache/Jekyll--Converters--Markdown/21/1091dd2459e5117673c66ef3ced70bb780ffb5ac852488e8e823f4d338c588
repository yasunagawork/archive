<p>I read this novel a while ago and I am now revising it because I am suspecting that it relates to 1) how I am thinking about otherness. 2)How we define living thing and non living things. 3)Being Asian decent in US. 4)Locality of matters. 5)New beings.</p>

<p>There are few aspect of this novel that I am still reflecting. I am making a list here to explore further connecting to adjason topics.</p>

<p>1) Shooters and the Farmers - local vs global
2) Three bodys - disruption of binary system
3) Michael Serre - doubles
4) Being asian - the east
5) three body computation</p>

<h2 id="shooter-and-farmer">Shooter and Farmer</h2>

<p>There is description of this concept “shooter and farmer” in the earlier of the novel. Here is the exerpt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Two words suddenly floated into his conciousness. Shooter and Farmer. When the members of the Frontier of science discuss science, they often use abriviation SF. They didn’t mean Science Fiction, but two words Shooter and Farmer. This was reference to two Hypothesis both involving the fundimental nature of the laws of the universe.</p>

    <p>In the shooter hypothesis, a good marksman shoots at the target creating hole every 10cm. Now supposed the cerface of the targed is inhabited by intelegent 2 dimentional creatures. Their scientist after observing the universe, discover a great law. There exist a hole in a universe every 10cm. They have mistaken the marksman’s momentary wim to an unalterable law of universe.</p>

    <p>The farmer hypothesis on the other hand, has a flavor of horror story. Every morning on a turky farm</p>

<p>I am particilary interested in this propasition where it proposes the questioning of entirety of basis of science. The theory is confirmed by the observation and hypothesis is made which then they measure and judge if that hold trueths. But these hypothesis chalenges what we call true to still hold the possibility of being temporal. In a way, even how things seem to be most likey true and so inprobable that things will be otherwise, it still is not 100%. I guess the point here is a chalenge agains ‘understanding’ we can have most strong theory but it is still a theory. There is no such things as 100%. It always leave a fraction of possibility for things to be otherwise. The importance of this hypothesis is that the truth that is fabricated (all truth is a fabrication) is understood as temporal and not absolute. It bring more weight to the locality. How we see pattern changes from trying to read the “universalness” to the pattern itself. Because now we see the locality of matter not as a fragments of universe but the universe itself.</p>
