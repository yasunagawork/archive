<p>I was in Baltimore for the weekend for a short short residency at the home of double-knot, Lorre-Mill. Will agreed to help me and work together on a new idea we have been talking about for few months on the design of the electronc mouth organ. We built a entirely new prototype to try out the idea. Our agenda was this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simplify and adjust the breath sencor opamp circuit</li>
  <li>Try LM13700 for VCA</li>
  <li>Power supply modulation with LM317</li>
</ol>

<p>The big idea to try was this, modulating the powersupply with the oscilator - which is powered by the modulated powersupply. Will this loop of ripple produce some compeling effect on the output?</p>
