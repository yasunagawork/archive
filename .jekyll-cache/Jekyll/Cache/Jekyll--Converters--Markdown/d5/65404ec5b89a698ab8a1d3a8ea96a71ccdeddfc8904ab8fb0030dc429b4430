<p>Will showed me an project by â€“ using audio synthesis program (supercollider) to generate a sound that microcontroer is programmed with. This technique is not a new and used in some devices like Korg for software update. They can be updated through audio inpit.</p>

<p>Watching this it made me wonder,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if we can program through making sounds with mouth?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relationship to body</li>
  <li>artificial organizms communicating with eachothers</li>
  <li>environment shaping the personality of being</li>
  <li>fast feedback to see the effect</li>
  <li>programming is making patterns</li>
  <li>learning songs for the programing</li>
  <li>Intuition</li>
  <li>agency (people should be able to develop personal relationship with devices beyond personalization)</li>
  <li>harnes the power of accidents</li>
  <li>program without goal or intention</li>
</ul>
