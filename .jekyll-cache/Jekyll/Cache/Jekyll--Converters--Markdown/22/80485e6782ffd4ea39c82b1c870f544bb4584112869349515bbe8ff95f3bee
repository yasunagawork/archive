<p>Adrian Piper’s writing “Ideology, Confrontation, and Political self Awareness” layout a guideline for self-examination towards self-awareness. It seems to be that text supposed to function towards the self and challenge the self in it’s beliefs. More explicitly false beliefs.</p>

<p>The examples she gives about false believes are quite obvious ones and also plausible. Despite of the relatively clear picture of how someone can create false belief and organize their actions and thought around to protect it, it does raise the question for me on “who” will decide it is a wrong belief in more nuanced situations? And this someone or moral judge - also needs to be a subject of self examination. In a belief that is more complex and intertwined with paradox of contemporary living how one can examine and come to this revision of beliefs? Specifically decide what is wrong? And how do we examine the one and moral judge who claim the rightness?</p>

<p>While this text starts out as a seemingly self guided - self examination, as text unfolds it is clear that readers role is to make the one with false beliefs to self examine themselves. Or the reader can inform their false belief and point out their behaviors towards them. It is sort of text book of spotting and remedy these people. The word “stupid” is used to describe pernicious effect of ideology. There seems to be a slight whiff of disgust and particularity in who is she talking about.</p>

<p>While her points on tendencies in our behaviors to protect our belief is well examine and analyzed, there seems to be an clear subject which these apply. While, wealthy, homophobics, transphobics and so on. Though this is written in 1981 and the this clarity might have been helpful to identify the tendency of how these people perpetuate their beliefs. Even if the audience and function is to address ignorance of right wing uncles, this text make scene, because who the reader should examen is clear. But should this be about correcting people though? Shouldn’t the target for self-examination the reader, us who might already think they are in a right moral ground? The wiritng has a good purpose and the message I recieve is about being suspecion of any thoughts and belief that we hold on to and they can change our behavior to hold them true.
The example seems to introduce the dynamic of senf and others.</p>

<p>The curious dynamic here is this. The one who are informed must examine and correct ones that are false. Towards the end of the essay, she writes this,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The antidote, I suggest, is confrontation of the sinner with the evidence of the sin: the rationalizations; the subconscious defense mechanisms; the strategies of avoidance, denial, dismissal…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christian ideology (or imprint of structure) lurk behind the dynamics of this relationships of two parties. Sinner and savior. This might be just and metaphor that was employed just for the sake of characterization. But it does register, especially in this Christian country, that there are dynamics of one who is enlightened and one who is not. It also assumes that recognized false beliefs are to be reinforced form an external force, which might be an valid method in situation. But could it be more of a process of interactive examination that can be processed collectively? Can we create the examination that does not come form superior moral place and knowledge the leaning as a self involved process and not an revision or corrections? Can we examine and EXPERIMENT with our believes without being told the falseness? As long as there are motivation and commitment to fluidity we should be able to create a space of self-exploration instead of self-examination. Examination is where we find a bad thing in our body. The language prompts this attitude. While something can be bad, can we also see beyond the bad, beyond correction towards general moral rightness, value in experimentation for ever nuanced thinking we are all capable of?</p>
