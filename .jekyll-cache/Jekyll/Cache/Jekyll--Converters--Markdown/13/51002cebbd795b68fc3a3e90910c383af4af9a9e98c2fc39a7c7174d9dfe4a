<p>We started the conversation with talking about the magnet on the bug. Magnet is an organ that allows bugs to be decisive on it‚Äôs position. It is not mechanical fastening which is done by me but the magnet is more of a natural force, the orientation of atoms, attractions. Alowance of it‚Äôs own preferences and attraction.</p>

<p>We looked and talked about the fire allarm piece. Introduction of new sonic element. It is warning system that holds our attention - communication system. Allowance of exisitance. 
They are also related in bodly sence, share piezo element as a vocal cord.</p>

<h2 id="landing---deployment">Landing - deployment</h2>

<p>We talked about how chainmail corlates to the idea of deployment and reforming/reinvisioning. Maluability of chainmail that drapes over form or creating form on its own corlates to the how the bug creates cluster and resituates to different colactions. Chainmail is almost like an instrunemnt. Millitary netting that covers object and transforms them into the disguised.</p>

<h2 id="mechanism-for-uterance">Mechanism for Uterance</h2>

<p>We looked at my most recent sculpture <i>Vessel for Ten Suns</i> and first thing that came up is that, this structure is a mechanism for utterance. It gives different voice to the bugs. Voice that we are familier in different way than the electronic buzz and clicks and chirps. Maybe thats electronic organ do in the first place is to take unfamilier sounds and phenomenons into recognisable and relatable form - piano and notational musical architecture.</p>

<p><b>Here the keyboard is adopting the bugs - bugs are adopting the keyboard - Keybord is being adapted. </b></p>

<p>He mentions about how the bug touches the keyboard cues the interaction. It animates movement. Especially one arm that touches the key itself. It emulates the touhing and pressing. Emulating what the hands do.</p>

<p>The bugs as accuired voices through prosthetics - the keyboard. Or is the bug the prosthetics? We have landed in the word Host. Keyboard stands for us as host.</p>

<p>Keyboard is designed to host human body. The size of keys, orientation of keys, frequency range, frequency devisions, scale, volume, they are property that made to host human being. Keyboard are now expanded it‚Äôs capability as a host. To be able to host bugs, tiny electrical being that creates tiny patterns from responding to the sun.</p>

<p>It is also an <b>Antena</b>. Antena as a place to access non things. Things in time space to access things that are further, and escapes our desire to comprehend. Funal as an event for accepting and atentivenes towards something unfathmable. Micharl says <b>‚Äúit‚Äôs not sad but rather optimistic‚Äù</b></p>

<h2 id="memisis-not-through-images">Memisis not through images</h2>

<p>We have talked about antherpromorphication of this unit through voices, touchpoints, scale, patterns. It seems to be that  antherpromorphication is coming from the feeling and not the image. Feeling of being.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Diagramatic vs Allucery</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>We talked about how this work differ from my last compositional installation with ‚Äútransient.‚Äù Composition with transient were more diagramatic ‚Äì it spreads horizontally and function dectated the form of space. I was trying to acheve a feeling of shrine procession but the form might have look too horizontal ‚Äì lacking hicherchy for the better or for worse.</p>

<p>Micharl describe <i>Vessel for Ten Suns</i> having more allucery quality, that breakdown our confrontation with cues. Confrontation of audience with work ‚Äì confrontation of ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù and this cue (and clues) that he talks about helps audience relate to it and gives accesspoint.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Modularity not for the sake of modularity but as <b> potential</b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Modularity here shifts the premis of goal oriented design that centers around human being as a recipient. The keyboard is designed with our body in mind. The size, orientations, mechanism, electrical design, of the keys are designed for human fingers. Further more, it is designed with division of frequencies from a tradition of western music. Design process of this keyboard is furhter complicated with goal of capital in manufacturing, ease of maintainance, user experiences. To open this fixed system is to destroy the goal of this object as a finished product. The new organ - the dongle - and extended body for this keyboard expands it‚Äôs potential as a design.</p>

<p>How does natural desin and human design differ? It is a goal orientedness (subjective goal) of human design that leads product desin in evolution. What if that goal was ofsetted or obscured? The evolution of product could expand its potential beyond human needs. Beyond needs. Design as a process.</p>
