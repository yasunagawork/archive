<p>This gathering is an historical tradition going back to china and still are held in contemporary setting among well establish shrines.</p>

<p>In a TV show â€œMonty Donâ€ presented the gokusui no utage as,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œparticipants read a poetry inspired by where the cup lands in the streamâ€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this description was inaccurate, It makes an compelling form of play where the reader creates based on the chance. From the reference of chance that is presented, he/she will respond and execute. This relationship to chance provide prompt to work from but not govern the work. It is an inspiration and physical anchor to ephemeral quality of now-ness.</p>
