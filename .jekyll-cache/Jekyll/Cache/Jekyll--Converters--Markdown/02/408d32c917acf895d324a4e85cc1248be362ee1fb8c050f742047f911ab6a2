<p>This gathering is an historical tradition going back to china and still are held in contemporary setting among well establish shrines.</p>

<p>In a TV show “Montey Don” presented the gokusui no utage as,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“participants read a poetry inspired bu where the cup lands in the stream”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this description was inacurate, It makes an compeling form of play where the reader creates based on the chance. From the reference of chance that is presented, he/she will respond and execute. This relationship to chance provide prompt to work from but not govern the work. It is an inspiration and physical anchor to ephemeral quality of now-ness.</p>
