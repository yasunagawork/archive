<p>After 6 month of being in other countries in Europe and my home in Japan, I have plenty of time to be away from my project in a capacity of conceptural rigor. I have brought bugs to everywhere I went and left quite a few in different locations. I have found few new hosts which I will continue the relationships with. Bugs were still around and intergrated to my life but I have not sat down to re observe their functions and potential.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are they and what do they do to our body and throughts?</li>
  <li>Why they exist and what they emblematise?</li>
  <li>How can this project grow?</li>
  <li>How this project can integrate and address the history of this medium?</li>
  <li>How can I chalenge archiving as a medium?</li>
  <li>How can archive chalenge the subject of this practice?</li>
  <li>How can this project exist as a publication?</li>
  <li>How can I push philosophical implication of this medium?</li>
  <li>How do I see this project in 10 years?</li>
  <li>What does child project do to the main project?</li>
</ul>

<p>Up on re-concepturalise this project, I have revisit the child projects that stemmed form Electronic Entomology that are sculptures, music, tools, and instalations. As I am applying to fellowship program of udk Berlin, I am making some</p>
