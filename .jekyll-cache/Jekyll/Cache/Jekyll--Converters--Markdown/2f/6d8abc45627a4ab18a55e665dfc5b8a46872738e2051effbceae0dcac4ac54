<p>LA times wrote an article of an interview with Christine Yano who was involved in the Hello Kitty retrospective show in LA in 2014. In that artice it talks about how Yano was firmly corrected by Sanyo (company desined Hello Kitty) that Hallo Kitty is not a cat.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-hello-kitty-in-los-angeles-not-a-cat-20140826-column.html">LAtimes article</a></p>

<p>This article blew up and people seemed have a strong reaction against it. It produced hundreads of responce articles and readit thread arguing and coping with this stated facts.</p>

<p>Recent 99% invisible episode covers this in a context of Yokai. <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/return-of-the-yokai/">Return of the Yokai</a></p>

<p>Interesting point here is people‚Äôs viseral reactions. Many people seems to not accept this creature that somewhat resembles a cat is not actually a cat, even there is ‚Äúkitty‚Äù in a name. It seems for somepeple that it is not a concebable and acceptable for this creature not to fall on a category they think it should.</p>

<p>Hello Kitty is clearly is not a cat it is an antherpromorphied creature and that is something different than the cat. And beyond the detailed justification of these statemnt, the creator said so. Here we just have to accept this new pattern and new category. The statement like this creats social gravity.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is an western expectation for the matters to fit in a category presisely? In a language and culture where subjects are often so fluid and left out of meaning the unknown is left to be unkown becasue that is what it is. Also something can be one thing and other thing at the same time neither. It is not only a healthy agitation on symbol system, it is an reminder that all symbol system is constructed and just and reference to what exist. Thing exist pararell to the symbol system and language and they don‚Äôt match always.</p>

<p>Western (and particulary American) obsession to binarism come in mind. Culture, politic, and social institution seem to push this idea of binarism in America in</p>
