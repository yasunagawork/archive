<p>Western culture has an obsession with Japanese culture in food, architecture, zen â€“ digestible, sellable, clean. It comes up and I recognize time to time this particular portion of culture that are attractive to people outside of Japan. They are sometimes things that are not as valued with in Japan. Many artists and cultural agent exports this quality of Japan. I am reflecting on what part of Japan-ness that I am aware and putting through my work. There are also more repulsive and grotesque part of Japanese-ness that are not exported or embraced that often. Takashi Murakami maybe tuning into the popularity of medium but also seem to embrace this grotesque quality of Japanese-ness.</p>

<p>Through as half-Japanese what does embrace or relating to quality of Japanese mean in my practice?
Is it an examination? I feel that I am not half per-ce but rather alien child. Than to posesses the ghost of Japan, what am I producing and why?</p>
