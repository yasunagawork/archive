<p>Aki mentioned On Kawaraâ€™s work to think about way the single work situate itself in the whole. How can work be seen to be expressing for the wholeness of the project?</p>

<p>What part of my work is specific? Can each bug possess parts or quality that make them more specific on their own existance while it situate themself in a larger system?</p>

<p>Word contract was mentioned. Gifting as a contract and it was part of this social experiment. How can Contract be more explicit and be part of the work?</p>

<p>On Kawaraâ€™s date paintings TODAT series demonstrate this relationship between part and the whole clearly. Painting was made on the date that is painted. While seeing the one paiting, I can experience the all instance of other dates painted all simultaniously. It make me aware of On Kawarâ€™s time and life as a constraints. The painting is accompanied with the newspaper of that day which connects this part to the larger context of moments in time that are outside of his immidiate time but collective time.</p>

<p>The series I READ, I GOT UP, I MET, I WENT all function in similar sence where it archives and documents his existance in time. The part expresses the whole.</p>

<p>Kawara made ONE HUNDRED YEARS CALENDAR that contain all dates of each 20th and 21st centry. In a same idea, he makes a work called ONE MILLION YEARS. This series of books contain 500 thousand years before and 500 thousand years after. The notion of time shifts from time of On Kawara, an single human to time of all humanity. His time, and each of all of our time is part of this book. We can see the scope and scale that is worked on.</p>
