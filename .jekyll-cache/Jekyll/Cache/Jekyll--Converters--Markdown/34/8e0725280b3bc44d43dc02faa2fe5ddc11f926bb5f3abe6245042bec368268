<p>‚ÄúCollective Experience for single sculpture‚Äù
‚ÄúCollective vs individual‚Äù</p>

<p>The topic of collectivity was mentioned few times. The work is experienced individually through their bug assigned. They are similar in it‚Äôs material and construction but they are also radically different from eachothers. The paradox of differenciation of collective vs individual experiences where they seem to be dependent of eachother. What makes things colletive and what makes individual?</p>

<p>Word communal was mentioned. In the context to pandemic, it was mentioned to have a sence of wanting to go back to place of collectivity. Especially from the installation, it was like a simulation, avators of ourselves gathering in space.</p>

<p>‚ÄúQuantifyable numbers? - production‚Äù
‚Äúpersonal vs inpersonal‚Äù</p>

<p>There was a conversations on personal vs inpersonal. Work stands in between gift that is made specificaly for a single person and mass manufactured objects. It is personal because there are hidden element that was inspired by the person that is gifted to but at the same time, others have very similar materiality and scale form eachother.</p>
