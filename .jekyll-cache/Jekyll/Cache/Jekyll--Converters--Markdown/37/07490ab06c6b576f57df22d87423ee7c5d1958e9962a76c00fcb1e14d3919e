<p>‚ÄúCollective Experience for single sculpture‚Äù
‚ÄúCollective vs individual‚Äù</p>

<p>The topic of collectivity was mentioned few times. The work is experienced individually through their bug assigned. They are similar in it‚Äôs material and construction but they are also radically different from eachothers. The paradox of differenciation of collective vs individual experiences where they seem to be dependent of eachother. What makes things colletive and what makes individual?</p>

<p>Word communal was mentioned. In the context to pandemic, it was mentioned to have a sence of wanting to go back to place of collectivity. Especially from the installation, it was like a simulation, avators of ourselves gathering in space.</p>

<p>‚ÄúQuantifyable numbers? - production‚Äù
‚Äúpersonal vs inpersonal‚Äù</p>

<p>There was a conversations on personal vs inpersonal. Work stands in between gift that is made specificaly for a single person and mass manufactured objects. It is personal because there are hidden element that was inspired by the person that is gifted to but at the same time, others have very similar materiality and scale form eachother.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As installation‚Äôs Circle from was read as ritualistic and communal, is the bug a social lubrecant? 
Some people seem to compare their bugs with eachothers. Can it function as a social object?</p>

<p>‚Äúcollectivity but also exclusion?‚Äù 
Collectivity was specifit to the group that was around myself. Which is interms of gift, the exchange was made as an engagement? Why did I not give to people not in the critique? Is that part of work that who I am giving this to? Can there be a design that this can get desiminated further? Is exclusion always a factor?</p>

<p>On Kawara‚Äôs date painting was mentioned by Aki (also in studio visits) that one painting that can speak for all other ones. Collectivity is expressed and relationship with all the other is clear in the material.</p>

<h3 id="the-host">the host</h3>

<p>The relationship between the bug and the host is simingly simple but potentially alot more unbiguouse. WHy do bugs cry? Often it is to find a mate. Is the mate the host? Mating for new life. If mating is between the host and the bug. What is being born?</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow it‚Äôs shared and lived around‚Äù 
Since the host share the living environment. The time spent together amouts to shared experience.</p>

<p>‚Äútrust is based on - not separate from the idea of survalance‚Äù
To asking someone to host strange electronic material involved trust since so many of our device is tuned to listen and monitor our behaviors. But can we design to remedy this idea of suvalance? the bug</p>

<p>‚Äúwho or what is being hosted?‚Äù
It was picked up on the idea of host and hosted. While Bugs are being hosted in host‚Äôs private environment, they also challenge our attentions. They also host our extended and imagined perception through bugs behavior. Bugs are also thing that tunes our body and behavior and how we see the architectures around us.</p>

<p>‚Äútuning us to say hello‚Äù
It demonds our attention. Attention for just a pile of metal, silicon, coarbon and plastics. But also tuning us to interact with them</p>

<p>‚Äúdomestication - gifted‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really receving gift‚Äù
The exchange of gift seem to read for some people some form of expectation for return. It puts responsibility. Or does it? What am I asking them for return? Some amount of engagement?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Bug)ging someone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Äúpolination - responsibility‚Äù
‚Äúvalue system that is given put on you‚Äù
It is a form of polination where the thought process and value is deciminated. Host is asked to deal with this value system.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDuality of gift - responsibility‚Äù
<a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/framed-get-the-gift-of-love-and-youre-perpetually-in-debt/">Interview with Mike Kelly</a> talked about this expectation of return of love.</p>

‚Äúmy parrot is curiouse about the sound bug makes‚Äù
‚Äúmimicary or simulation of sound. Do we need original anymore? Do we need insects anymore?‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The acoustic niche hypothesis predicts, in a mature ecosystem, species will avoid competition by singing at unique bandwidths, or pitches, at unique times. Therefore, no two species should sing simultaneously at the same frequency.</p>
