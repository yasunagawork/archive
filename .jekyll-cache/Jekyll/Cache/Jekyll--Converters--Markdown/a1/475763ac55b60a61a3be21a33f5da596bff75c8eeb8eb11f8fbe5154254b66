<hr />

<p>How do we approach a studio vist when my work seem to have already registered in certain configuration within his taxonomy of art and language. How do we undo the singularity created by his assumption of what kind of sculpture I am trying to create, that is entangled with charactor building of who I am and most strongly, limited refenrence that corresponds with cirtain idea of sculptural work with sound. This further compicates the misundrstanding of details of work. Not only misunderstanding but denile for correction. What do we do with that though? Is there something here? Can the work solidifies in one way and desolve again. Can a work change to a point that there is no way for him to re configure his entire narrative? <b>Can the work betray him? </b> for the sake of it’s own truth?</p>

<p>Why does it seems like electronic material is always expected to “dance” and pose to be able to register as an art. I am interested in the aesthetic that come from nenesity, and aesthetesizing a parts of electronic just to look like a sculpture seems like me trying to pose extra japanese in my work to be exotified. The electronic as a material often an vessel for the projection of our image towards technology in a vagues sence.</p>
