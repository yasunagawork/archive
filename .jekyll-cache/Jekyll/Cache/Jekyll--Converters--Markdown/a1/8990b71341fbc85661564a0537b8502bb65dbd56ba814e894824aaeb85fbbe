<p>I have entertained the idea of electronic wind instrument in 2018 with Will Schorre when I was living in Baltimore. We have experimented with wind sensor ideas for the electronic instrument. I am revisiting the prototypes we made and document the process of producing an another iteration.</p>

<p>One of my inspiration for this study was my interest in the relationship between the instrument and the body. Interfacing with electronic instruments particularly with synthesizers, often how our body relate to the patterns of electrons are through patching, push/toggle buttons, knobs, slides, keyboards, joysticks, etc. Most of them involve the interaction through fingers. Is there other aspect of our bodily property that interface with the system? Could other modes of interfacing to the system provide different kind of embodiment of system in performance? How can we introduce/project/transfer physical property of our body into the system?</p>

<p>Thinking about different traditional acoustic instruments, the way wind instruments highlights nuance of our breath came to mind. Physical restraints of our lung capacity gives characteristics to the performance. The patterns created by breath can be very nuanced and controlled in such a subtle way. Starting with slowly exhaling then gradually strengthen the breath and end abruptly. Rhythmically start and stop exhaling gradually weakening. Inhale twice and exhale three time over and over. Our breath is so tied to the size of hour lung, diaphragm, ab muscles, and further shapes by architecture of mouth – tongue and cheek and lips.</p>

<p>At the time of this thoughts, I was listening to music from Laos that involves a wind instrument (mouth organ) called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khene">Khaene</a>. Khaene is a traditional wind instrument originated in Laos dates back to the bronze age. It is a free reed instrument, the ancestor of harmonica and an polyphonic instrument, the ancestor of pipe organs. Free reeds allow performer to play notes both when performer is inflating and exhaling. I was interested in the rhythms of breathing that creates percussive quality within the melodic notes and cords in this instrument.</p>
