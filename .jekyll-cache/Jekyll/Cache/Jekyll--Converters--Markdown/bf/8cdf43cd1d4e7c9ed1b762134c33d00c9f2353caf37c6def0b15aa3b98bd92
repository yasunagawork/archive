<p>This is a long list of unvisited, undigested material to be digested int eh future</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simplify and adjust the breath sencor opamp circuit</li>
  <li>Try LM13700 for VCA</li>
  <li>Power supply modulation with LM317</li>
</ol>

<p>The big idea to try was this, modulating the powersupply with the oscilator - which is powered by the modulated powersupply. Will this loop of ripple produce some compeling effect on the output?</p>
