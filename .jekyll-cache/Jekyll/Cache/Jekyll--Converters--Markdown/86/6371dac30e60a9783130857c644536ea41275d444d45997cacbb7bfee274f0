<p>Elizabeth mentions about Aki’s presentation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Object as a score</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking about objects in the space not as props but score itself. Objects leads the actions that talkes place on the site.
What does it meant to give what they want?</p>

<p><b> What does it mean to think about what they want?</b> Elizabeth also mentiones about elaborate hydroponic system.
They are sustainable closed system for particular condidition. Do I want to think of this as closed system? What is my role in this?</p>

<p>This question creates further questions…</p>

<p>-What is their goal as a species?
-What do they want besides sunlight and steel? 
-What does it mean for them to spread?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>they need to be moving around</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, this poses more questions,</p>

<p>-What is the parametor of the moving?
-How will they move?
-When will they move?</p>

<p>Maybe is is a game of go. Slowly occupying space, surrounds thigs.
Maybe a game of go with one player against interchangible multiple players.</p>

<p>Opponents are,</p>

<p>-shadow?
-western coherency?
-categorization?</p>

<h3 id="ambivalence-unvivalence">Ambivalence (Unvivalence)</h3>

<p>The word <i> ambivalence </i> was mentioned.</p>

<p>Definitions</p>

<ol>
  <li>1 - having mixed feelings about someone or something; being unable to choose between two (usually opposing) courses of action: The whole family was ambivalent about the move to the suburbs.She is regarded as a morally ambivalent character in the play.</li>
  <li>2 - Psychology. of or relating to the coexistence within an individual of positive and negative feelings toward the same person, object, or action, simultaneously drawing him or her in opposite directions.</li>
</ol>

<p>This word was mentioned in responce to all my questions. There is something about this species that seems to have ambivalence quality. Or wnat to be in that space. Whenever the question of “is it alive or not” is brough up, I am often frustrated with the desire to categorise them in that manner. <b> is that question even a usuful question anymore? </b>
Maybe they do want to be in that space of anbivalance. To be categorised but then keeps on moving, expanding, clinging, to escape the container.</p>

<p>It is the contraditions. Both are true and both are false. Is is here and there. Can we push through the desire of language and categorization, or pressure to take sides, certainty. Push through and mix them ireversibly. 3rd body is created. Body that moves, mixes, vibrates, posesses.</p>

<p>I initially thought ambivalence was unvivalance. When I first looked it up, it showed quite technical definition.</p>

<p>Definitions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b> Genetics Of or relating to a chromosome that is not paired or united with its homologous chromosome during synapsis. </b></li>
</ol>

<p>Chromosome that is not paired or unpaired with its homologouse chromosome. It is before the state of cirtainty. or state before it is defined by it’s recognised oponent.
Unpaired is state of suspention. State of possibility. Before the storm. I guess but on the otherhand, maybe it can be a stagnant space.
Isolated.</p>

<p>Important things for me is that all things are temporary. Categorizations are an object of suspention. It exist in virtural space. 
No mater how much we are cirtain about things. how we define is only in relation to who we are.
How can we remind ourselves that all things are movign and all things are temporary. With in that connections and clingyness of things that produces culture is not a ramdom.</p>

<p>I am not interested in chance operation to define all things. Things are particular. but they are moving.</p>

<p>I think I want them to infoltrate the space of our language. I want it to taunt us. Take over how we define things. make it their own. 
To create new objects out of one we know. Claim, infest, and infect our language.</p>
