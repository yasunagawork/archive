## Electronic Wind Instrument

I have entertained the idea of electronic wind instrument in 2018 with Will Schorre when I was living in Baltimore. We have experimented with wind sensor ideas for the electronic instrument. I am revisiting the prototypes we made and document the process of producing an another iteration.

### the body 

One of my inspiration for this study was my interest in the relationship between the instrument and the body. Interfacing with electronic instruments particularly with synthesizers, often how our body relate to the patterns of electrons are through patching, push/toggle buttons, knobs, slides, keyboards, joysticks, etc. Most of them involve the interaction through fingers. Is there other aspect of our bodily property that interface with the system? Could other modes of interfacing to the system provide different kind of embodiment of system in performance? How can we introduce/project/transfer physical property of our body into the system? 

Thinking about different traditional acoustic instruments, I got interested in the way wind instruments highlights nuance and limit of our body through breath. Physical restraints of our lung capacity gives characteristics to the performance. The patterns created by breath can be very nuanced and controlled in such a subtle way. Our breath is so tied to movement of our lung, diaphragm, ab muscles, and further shaped by architecture of mouth -- tongue and cheek and lips. 

### the simple idea 

Will have shown me a work done by -- on simple wind sensor for wind instrunment. The simple low tech idea to not only to detect the presence and absence of breath but to get a sensetive variation and nuance and range of breath, --- have come up with elegant idea that is  - reading the change of resistance of photoresistor shined by the LED across the chainber where diaphrame will buckle up and change the amount of light shined when one blows. 
Taking this simple idea I iterated this design to be able to read exhale and inhale like a harmonica. This will expand this design to be expressive in a rhythmical and percussive style.

### Khaene (khene) - Laosian traditional instrument

At the time of this thoughts, I was listening to music from Laos that involves a wind instrument (mouth organ) called [Khaene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khene). Khaene is a traditional wind instrument originated in Laos dates back to the bronze age. It is a free reed instrument, the ancestor of harmonica and an polyphonic instrument, pipe organs. Free reeds allow performer to play notes both when performer is inhaling and exhaling. I was interested in the rhythms of breathing that creates percussive quality within the melodic notes and cords in this instrument.
