##  Gift - constant exchange of spiritual matter

This is a first of notes taken from reading the book "the gift" by Marcel Mauss.

---

### Potlatch

Mauss started with introducing the idea and the exchange the gift and presents functioning as a form of contract. Gift that seems volantary is actually obligatory. Communities are connected to each other to create a larger societal whole and gift is one of they ways that sustains the connections between communities. Gift exchanges in community scale includes, rituals, ceremonies, millitary services, food, women, children, are exchanged not for econimical interest or but rather continuing the long lasting relationship of honor and resoporocity. They are for the alliance of rivery trives while there are still are conflicts whithin them. He calls this relationship "system of total services" that engages both parties in social, cultural and economical sence for a better or for worse. 
He employed Tsinuk term "potlatch"

> We propose to reserve the term potlatch for this kind off institution that, with less risk and more accurecy, but also at greater length, we might call: total service of an agonistic type. (p8)

The gift can exist within conflists. In a way, the gift deal with relationship in material and spiritual realm. For the better of worse gift deals with kinship with and excirsise the reflection of that relationship. 


### Hau - spirit of things - things must return


In a first chaper Mauss gives example from Polynesian community Maori. For Maori people gift is also a vihicle for mana – magical, religiouse, spiritural force. Gift posesses "hau" the spirit of things which in the book Maori person describe it, 

>I will speak to you about the hau...The hau is not the wind that blows—not at all. Let us suppose that you possess a certain article (taonga) and that you give me this article. You give it me without setting a price on it. We strike no bargain about it. Now, I give this article to a third person who, after a certain lapse of time, decides to give me something as payment in return (utu). He makes a present to me of something (taonga). Now, this taonga that he gives me is the spirit (hau) of the taonga that I had received from you and that I had given to him. The taonga that I received for these taonga (which came from you) must be returned to you. It would not be fair (tika) on my part to keep these taonga for myself, whether they were desirable (rawe) or undesirable (kino). I must give them to you because they are a hau of the taonga that you gave me. If I kept this other taonga for myself, serious harm might befall me, even death. This is the nature of the hau, the hau of personal property, the hau of the taonga, the hau of the forest. Kati ena (But enough on this subject). (p14)

and eleborate 

>in Maori law, the legal tie, a tie occurring through things, is one between souls, because the thing itself possesses a soul, is of the soul. Hence it follows that to make a gift of something to someone is to make a present of some part of oneself. (16)


### Exchange of essence of self - relationsips - Carlo Rovelli - non human beings

To exchange something is to exhange oneself, and one's spiritural essence. Another point here is that all gift is meant to retun to the origin. Which makes the exchange forever? Bond itself is in the form of exchange so maybe there are no relationship without the gifts. 

Everything including food, property, tailsmans, land, labor services, and ranks are all meant to be passed on to another. Constance exchange is a mandatory and required in the community. The exhange is a symbol for relationsip. Exchange is mixing, mixing of spirits, mixing of oneself. It is like inducing chemical reaction by mixing things. 

This reminds me of way Carlo Rovelli talks about happening. Reality is a series of happenings. Things are there because they are in proximity to eachothers. The culture in this sence is kind of like how Rovelli talks, in that without the exchange there is no culture, or rather community. At least culture beyond individuals. It is like a polination of self, ideas, sensetivity, history, and spirit. 

In this sence what does relationsip with non human entity look like? How do we exchange? How do we engage, gift, and have relationship of resoporocity? Is that even possible or good way of thinking for extending our awareness? 

Mauss describes on Chapter 1 section 4 (Note: the present made to the humans, and the present made to the gods) that among Northeast Siberia and West Alaskan Eskimos (I assume Inuit people that he is talking about), exchange of gift extends to the spirits, the deads, and the gods. In sacrifises, people are exchange with the gods. In some cases, exchanges are made to make piece with gods.
