## Adorno on the new

> The relation to the new is modeled on a child at the piano searching for a chord never previousely heard. This chord, however, was always there: the possible combinations are limited and actually everything that can be played on it is implicitly given in the keyboard. The new is the longing for the new, not the new itself: That is what everything new suffers from.  - p32


This is an exerpt from Theodor Adorno's "Aesthetic Theory" 

### Newness

This newness here is what I recognise time to time. In marketing of electronic devices for instance. We have been in a loop of same object and concept since the beggingiing of computer. First text, than images, than audio, than video. Generations and generations of devices are exactly the same device that are to carry these contents. The difference is faster and higher resulution. Even the recent developing of VR, most of what is marketed is just to see what we already know.

In contemorary news cycle, any segnificat movement does not last long as a topic on news. Most of event gets a attention and than quickly loses the taste. I have noticed a gum I bought at the train startion had a similar design. It was painfully sweet that extract so much saliva from my mouth and than the sweetness dissapear quickly leaving my tastebuds with a feeling of ghost tastless goo. It makes body throw away this ghost and chew a new one. It seems like an technique to get people to want more. Want the new. 


### instrunment 
This metaphor of piano paritculary pulled my thoughts into the idea of instrunment and devices and their relation to our creative expressions. The implicity of the piano gives the structure to work from. In here it seems that idea of longing for the new can criple the work? Maybe that to make "the new" it has to reside to what exist. Like athism relies it's existance to the existing religion. So work motivated form the idea of new will not be new because it wants to be new - at least in an architecture that is given? 

What if a child learns that you can actually tune a piano? And upon examination of craft and tequnique, if child leans how to make a piano. What does that mean?


### implicity

Adorno goes on in a same paragraph,

>the end of art is impicit in its concept.

The contradiction and differences between idea and work. It is discussed here as opposite force or saparate entities. How can work be implicit in it's comcept? When the work is about it's own medium? Or when the work doesn't recognize the impossibility of perfect depiction? Do concept be thought as separate as the work?
