## shoosh

Will showed me an project by -- using audio synthesis program (supercollider) to generate a sound that microcontroer is programmed with. This technique is not a new and used in some devices like Korg for software update. They can be updated through audio inpit.

Watching this it made me wonder,

>What if we can program through making sounds with mouth?



+ Relationship to body 
+ artificial organizms communicating with eachothers
+ environment shaping the personality of being
+ fast feedback to see the effect
+ programming is making patterns 
+ learning songs for the programing
+ Intuition
+ agency (people should be able to develop personal relationship with devices beyond personalization)
+ harnes the power of accidents
+ program without goal or intention
