## Three Body Problem

I read this novel a while ago and I am now revising it because I am suspecting that it relates to 1) how I am thinking about otherness. 2)How we define living thing and non living things. 3)Being Asian decent in US. 4)Locality of matters. 5)New beings.

There are few aspect of this novel that I am still reflecting. I am making a list here to explore further connecting to adjason topics.

1) Shooters and the Farmers - local vs global
2) Three bodys - disruption of binary system
3) Michael Serre - doubles
4) Being asian - the east
5) three body computation

## Shooter and Farmer

There is description of this concept "shooter and farmer" in the earlier of the novel. Here is the exerpt.


> Two words suddenly floated into his consciousness: “shooter” and “farmer.”

>When the members of the Frontiers of Science discussed physics, they often used the abbreviation “SF.” They didn’t mean “science fiction,” but the two words “shooter” and “farmer.” This was a reference to two hypotheses, both involving the fundamental nature of the laws of the universe.

>In the shooter hypothesis, a good marksman shoots at a target, creating a hole every ten centimeters. Now suppose the surface of the target is inhabited by intelligent, two-dimensional creatures. Their scientists, after observing the universe, discover a great law: “There exists a hole in the universe every ten centimeters.” They have mistaken the result of the marksman’s momentary whim for an unalterable law of the universe.

>The farmer hypothesis, on the other hand, has the flavor of a horror story: Every morning on a turkey farm, the farmer comes to feed the turkeys. A scientist turkey, having observed this pattern to hold without change for almost a year, makes the following discovery: “Every morning at eleven, food arrives.” On the morning of Thanksgiving, the scientist announces this law to the other turkeys. But that morning at eleven, food doesn’t arrive; instead, the farmer comes and kills the entire flock.

I am particilary interested in this propasition where it proposes the questioning of entirety of basis of science. The theory is confirmed by the observation and hypothesis is made which then they measure and judge if that hold trueths. But these hypothesis chalenges what we call true to still hold the possibility of being temporal. In a way, even how things seem to be most likey true and so inprobable that things will be otherwise, it still is not 100%. I guess the point here is a chalenge agains 'understanding' we can have most strong theory but it is still a theory. There is no such things as 100%. It always leave a fraction of possibility for things to be otherwise. The importance of this hypothesis is that the truth that is fabricated (all truth is a fabrication) is understood as temporal and not absolute. It bring more weight to the locality. How we see pattern changes from trying to read the "universalness" to the pattern itself. Because now we see the locality of matter not as a fragments of universe but the universe itself.

How do this translate to my practice?
