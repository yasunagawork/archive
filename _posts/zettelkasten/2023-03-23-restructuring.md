## Re-concepturalising the essence of Electronic Entomology

After 6 month of being in other countries in Europe and my home in Japan, I have plenty of time to be away from my project in a capacity of conceptural rigor. I have brought bugs to everywhere I went and left quite a few in different locations. I have found few new hosts which I will continue the relationships with. Bugs were still around and intergrated to my life but I have not sat down to re observe their functions and potential. 

- What are they and what do they do to our body and throughts? 
- Why they exist and what they emblematise? 
- How can this project grow? 
- How this project can integrate and address the history of this medium?
- How can I chalenge archiving as a medium? 
- How can archive chalenge the subject of this practice?
- How can this project exist as a publication?
- How can I push philosophical implication of this medium?
- How do I see this project in 10 years? 
- What does child project do to the main project? 

Upon re-concepturalise this project, I have revisit the child projects that stemmed form Electronic Entomology that are sculptures, music, tools, and instalations. As I am applying to fellowship program of udk Berlin.
