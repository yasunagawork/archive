We are not a one thing.
Multitude of indivisuals

Where our body end?

"point of view" 

Our city is an expresion of our DNA




Breaking down the world to things and event's so we can "think" about them.


"Maya"  

Ma-   to measure  (matter, matrix, metric)

we can think aobut our wigly world with grid (reference) so we cant talk abut them. 

Maya is only a one prespective of looking at the world. World devided in to separate pieces are not really a separate.

Master card marketting the "priceless"

â€œThe world that can be described is never the same as the world that exists. The described world and real world are incommensurable. People are hypnotised and bewitched by words. You must never lose sight of that. Or you eat the menu instead of the dinner, or swallow the money.


We mistake

-map to land
-recipe to food
-score to music
-category to traits
-description to observation
-image to experience
-text to knowledges
-romance to love

so how can we remedy this habit? 
What happens when the 

recipe is made of food?
map is made of land?
score is made of music?

Can the referent be made with the reference itself? To close the gap between this two separate prospective of the world? Can map made out of land inform the actual dynamc quality of land while still being a map (fragment and projection of idea of the land)? Maybe what is expressed here is a "model". Model that is not only a measurement, algorythm, image of sumehting but also capture a patters, dynamic movement, force and form of things. In this operation can we have a different relationship, regain a trust to our sences and prospective of world that have to trust your own sences to experience the dynamic quality from your own body. 

Can we make a model that doesn't feel like the models is a reference to some "things" and "events" elsewhare but rather the "things" and "events" themselves? And can it excirsise patterns in first person to give a actual experience from our body?
