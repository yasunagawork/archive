<hr />

<h3 id="one-and-whole---collectivity">One and whole - collectivity</h3>

<p>“Collective Experience for single sculpture”
“Collective vs individual”</p>

<p>The topic of collectivity was mentioned few times. The work is experienced individually through their bug assigned. They are similar in it’s material and construction but they are also radically different from eachothers. The paradox of differenciation of collective vs individual experiences where they seem to be dependent of eachother. What makes things colletive and what makes individual?</p>

<p>Word communal was mentioned. In the context to pandemic, it was mentioned to have a sence of wanting to go back to place of collectivity. Especially from the installation, it was like a simulation, avators of ourselves gathering in space.</p>

<p>“Quantifyable numbers? - production”
“personal vs inpersonal”</p>

<p>There was a conversations on personal vs inpersonal. Work stands in between gift that is made specificaly for a single person and mass manufactured objects. It is personal because there are hidden element that was inspired by the person that is gifted to but at the same time, others have very similar materiality and scale form eachother.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>puppy coming back together to play - social occation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As installation’s Circle from was read as ritualistic and communal, is the bug a social lubrecant? 
Some people seem to compare their bugs with eachothers. Can it function as a social object?</p>

<p>“collectivity but also exclusion?” 
Collectivity was specifit to the group that was around myself. Which is interms of gift, the exchange was made as an engagement? Why did I not give to people not in the critique? Is that part of work that who I am giving this to? Can there be a design that this can get desiminated further? Is exclusion always a factor?</p>

<p>On Kawara’s date painting was mentioned by Aki (also in studio visits) that one painting that can speak for all other ones. Collectivity is expressed and relationship with all the other is clear in the material.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>bug - calling is cry for reproduction - call for mating</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-host">the host</h3>

<p>The relationship between the bug and the host is simingly simple but potentially alot more unbiguouse. WHy do bugs cry? Often it is to find a mate. Is the mate the host? Mating for new life. If mating is between the host and the bug. What is being born?</p>

<p>“How it’s shared and lived around” 
Since the host share the living environment. The time spent together amouts to shared experience.</p>

<p>“trust is based on - not separate from the idea of survalance”
To asking someone to host strange electronic material involved trust since so many of our device is tuned to listen and monitor our behaviors. But can we design to remedy this idea of suvalance? the bug</p>

<p>“who or what is being hosted?”
It was picked up on the idea of host and hosted. While Bugs are being hosted in host’s private environment, they also challenge our attentions. They also host our extended and imagined perception through bugs behavior. Bugs are also thing that tunes our body and behavior and how we see the architectures around us.</p>

<p>“tuning us to say hello”
It demonds our attention. Attention for just a pile of metal, silicon, coarbon and plastics. But also tuning us to interact with them</p>

<p>“more needy tamagochi – or less?”</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-gift">the gift</h3>

<p>“domestication - gifted”
“I don’t really like receving gift”
The exchange of gift seem to read for some people some form of expectation for return. It puts responsibility. Or does it? What am I asking them for return? Some amount of engagement?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Bug)ging someone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“polination - responsibility”
“value system that is given put on you”
It is a form of polination where the thought process and value is deciminated. Host is asked to deal with this value system.</p>

<p>“Duality of gift - responsibility”
<a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/framed-get-the-gift-of-love-and-youre-perpetually-in-debt/">Interview with Mike Kelly</a> talked about this expectation of return of love.</p>

Sharing of experience is part of work</p>

<h3 id="mimicry">Mimicry</h3>

<p>“bugs in the summer”</p>

<p>Installation of gathering of 26 bugs had a many reaction for calm and nostalgic feeling. Some said it made them feel large and did not want to desturb the gathering. Some stayed a long time. It was just like the hot summer night when you can’t sleep and you can hear all the crikets and insects sounding outside in the forest in the distance.</p>

<p>“Shadow casting death - taking over everything what is animating energy - both bugs and us” 
Installation also provided some way to connect viewers body to the bugs presence.</p>

<p>“mimicry or simulation of sound. Do we need original anymore? Do we need insects anymore?”
Minicry was mentioned few times. The bug made synthesised sound but strangly realistic when all of them are together. The speaking to nostalgia and the longing. Hayao Miyazaki’s animation was also mentioned in a way his animation depicts not the photorealistic of nature but rather the feeling and quality of it.</p>

<p>Also dipiction, animation that is not about realistic in a sence of image or idea but quality.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>acoustic niche -</strong>
The acoustic niche hypothesis predicts, in a mature ecosystem, species will avoid competition by singing at unique bandwidths, or pitches, at unique times. Therefore, no two species should sing simultaneously at the same frequency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“flytying”</p>

<p>“is it a bug? why do you call it bug? It can and is something else?”
It is clearly something else but why do I call it bug? does it matter that it bleads out of the definition of bug? or does it? Can it extends how we think about bugs?</p>

<p>“spy fake animatronic animals placed by scientists in the wilderness. And the phenomenon when they accept the fake animal”
“my parrot is curiouse about the sound bug makes”
There are potential to think about how bugs make relationship to not only human but other beings. Can it be a host for spiders? Can it interact with global warming as an object? How can that be manifested?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="multiplicity">Multiplicity</h3>

<p>How do this work exisit? Not without bugs but there are parts to this work that introduced more element into the extent of work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>package</li>
  <li>drawing</li>
  <li>accompany object</li>
  <li>act of giving</li>
  <li>the gathering installation</li>
  <li>recording</li>
  <li>photograph</li>
  <li>bug itself</li>
  <li>hosts</li>
  <li>host’s domestic space</li>
</ul>

<p>Primary source is fragmental and intertwined with larger time frame. Time frame of relationship of me and the gifted.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hyeree – Biblical?</p>

<p>Most analog object like a old tractor
Desmond was interacting with a bug similer to his old tractor.</p>

<p>“making electronics frendly again”</p>
